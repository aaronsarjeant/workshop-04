# Workshop 4

By: Aaron Sarjeant

## Emphasis

In only 60 years, *the field of computing and information systems* has redefined the traditional ways of business, education, government, and entertainment.  Virtually every _organization and every field of study rely on computers and related technologies to_ succeed in the Information Age.  Even our everyday vocabulary embraces words like The Internet, email, Google, Facebook, YouTube, MP3, ATM, and Wii.

## Strong

The **study of computing and information systems is central** to our understanding of how the world processes, manages and __communicates information using digital__ technologies.  As a student, you learn to build and use computing and information systems.  You learn to see things from a broader systems perspective and to develop integrated solutions that meet the needs of your users.  And you learn to appreciate the far-reaching cultural, ethical, and legal impact of digital systems.
